Hocrtex
=======

Hocr is html microformat for information from OCR packages. You can find more information about hocr in this [document](https://docs.google.com/View?docid=dfxcv4vc_67g844kf). It can be generated by [tesseract v3.0>=](http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/), [ocropus](http://code.google.com/p/ocropus/) or [cuneiform](https://launchpad.net/cuneiform-linux) programs. With hocrtex, it is possible to use this information from LaTeX and convert this file to PDF. 

Hocrtex is based on xmltex, xml processor written in TeX.

Usage
-----
First, you need to get hocr file. You have to process images from your scanned book with one of OCR packages listed above.

In tesseract, you can generate hocr output with this procedure:

1.  Create file named "hocr", put it somewhere and copy this line into it:
    
    `tessedit_create_hocr 1`
    
2.  call tesseract
    
    `tesseract imagename outputname -l lang_name +path_to_hocr/hocr`

Now we have html file with hocr information.    

For processing with hocrtex, we need to generate config file using package `hocrconfig`.

Create file sample.tex:

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage[
       FileName=normal % name of hocr file without .html suffix
      ,ResizeRatio=5.5 % division from bbox coordinates to points
      ,ImageName=normal-
    ]{hocrconfig}
    \begin{document}
    \end{document}
   
process
